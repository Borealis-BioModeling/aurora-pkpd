Welcome to the Fit/Train page! Here, you can upload your concentration-time
profiles and train your pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model
to fit the data, calibrating your model to your experimental/clinical observations. 
Use this feature to enhance your models predictive capabilities and estimate 
PK parameters for processes like distribution and elimination.

The Fit/Train feature is still under development, including the creation
of another PySB add-on and its integration
into this web app. To accelerate its completion, Iâ€™m seeking your support.

Please consider contributing to my fundraising goal to implement this
and other Aurora PK/PD features. Every contribution helps cover my time as an
independent developer and helps get me closer to delivering a more robust set of
open-source tools for PK/PD modeling and analysis.

Welcome to the Analyze page! Here, you can perform detailed
analyses of your pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model,

The Analyzer feature is still under development. 
To accelerate its completion, Iâ€™m seeking your support.

Please consider contributing to my fundraising goal to implement this
and other Aurora PK/PD features. Every contribution helps cover my time as an
independent developer and helps get me closer to delivering a more robust set of
open-source tools for PK/PD modeling and analysis.

Welcome to the NCA page! Here, you can upload your
concentration-time profiles and perform non-compartmental
pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis on the data. Use this feature to
calculate key PK parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC, and half-life, without 
assuming any specific compartmental model.

The Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA) feature
is still under development, including the creation
of a Python-based NCA package and its integration
into this web app. To accelerate its completion, Iâ€™m seeking your support.

Please consider contributing to my fundraising goal to implement this
and other Aurora PK/PD features. Every contribution helps cover my time as an
independent developer and helps get me closer to delivering a more robust set of
open-source tools for PK/PD modeling and analysis.
